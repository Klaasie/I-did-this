# I did this - a google chrome extension

This is a chrome extension for generating Tin Can statements with just a right click.

# Installation
- Clone the repository
- head to chrome://extensions/
- Enable developermodus and import the extension file
- Go to the config page and insert LRS and userinformation

# Usage
Rightclick and move to the I did this menu item. Select a verb and the extension will send the information to your LRS.
You can either rightclick a page and the extension will take the website title as object or select a piece of text (like a headline) which will then be the object to your Tin Can Statement.


@todo:
- Develop functions for configurable verbs
